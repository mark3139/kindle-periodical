    <p>Exciting times for The Great Gatsby, which is gifted its second association with celebrity effluent in recent memory.</p>
    <p>Only last year, you may recall, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/lostinshowbiz/2012/apr/12/solange-great-gatsby-novel-desert" title="">the novel was pressed into service by Solange Knowles</a>, singer sister of Beyonc&#233;. "True story," tweeted Solange. "Out of gas. Stranded in the Texas desert. Had to pee by the railroad. Wiped with pages of The Great Gatsby."</p>
    <p>This week, Fitzgerald's masterpiece is linked to stream-of-incontinence reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians, with Carey Mulligan declaring that the character of Daisy Buchanan is "like a Kardashian". If that sounds like the zeitgeist meeting the shite-geist, bear with her.</p>
    <p>"She feels like she's living in a movie of her own life," explains Mulligan of her portrayal of Daisy in Baz Luhrmann's forthcoming Gatsby adaptation. "She's&#160;constantly on show, performing all the time. Nothing bad can happen in&#160;a dream. You can't die in a dream. She's in her own TV show. She's like a&#160;Kardashian."</p>
    <p>Not a bad reading at all, and Lost in Showbiz looks forward to seeing it.</p>
    <p>What would be a missed trick, however, is for the Kardashians to ignore the reference. It would certainly be unthinkable for them to fail to attempt to monetise it. Lost in Showbiz sees one of those rapidly proliferating Kardashian spinoff strands, perhaps with the working title "Kourtney &amp; Kim Take West Egg".</p>
    <p>Episode breakdown remains a closely guarded secret, but I'd like to think we'd see plotlines such as: "Are all the guests at this insanely lavish party employed by the E! channel?" and "An argument about closet space turns into a hilarious sexy shirt fight".</p>
    <p>Kanye as Gatbsy, obviously.</p>
